# Introduction

This repository contains a Go implementation for sorting LinkedIn stories using a custom algorithm. The project aims to tackle real-world complexities such as edge case handling and performance optimization, making it an excellent resource for Go developers interested in enhancing their skills in data structures and algorithms.

### Getting Started

1. Go version 1.21.5
2. Git
3. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/samsond/Go-LinkedIn-Sorter.git`
4. Navigate to the project directory `cd Go-LinkedIn-Sorter`
5. Execute All Tests in the Module `go test ./...`
6. Execute Tests in Specific Packages `go test ./pkg/sorter` and `go test ./pkg/model`

### challenge

1. Implement Additional Sorting Criteria: For example, sorting by `likes` or `post date`.
2. Refactor to Use `Interface-Based` Sorting: This approach would allow more flexible sorting strategies and could be a great exercise in Go interface design.
3. Optimize for Performance: If you're interested in performance tuning, explore ways to optimize the sorting algorithm for large datasets.
